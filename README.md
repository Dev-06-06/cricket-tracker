## What is CricTrack?

Every cricket scoring app assumes both teams are locked before the match starts, overs never change, and no player can appear in both sides. None of that is true in turf cricket, college cricket, or gully cricket.

CricTrack is a real-time match management platform built specifically for local cricket — where a player shows up late, overs get renegotiated mid-game, and one person genuinely plays for both teams. It handles the full match lifecycle from toss to career stats, syncing every delivery instantly across all connected devices via WebSockets.

## Why CricTrack Exists

| What other apps assume | What actually happens in local cricket |
|---|---|
| Both squads locked before match | Players show up late — add them mid-game |
| Overs never change | "Let's make it 8 overs" after over 3 |
| No player on both teams | One strong player bats and bowls for both sides |
| Substitutions follow official rules | Bench a batter, bring them back later |

CricTrack is the only scoring platform built around these realities.

### ⚡ Live Scoring
- Record every delivery — runs, wides, no-balls, byes, leg-byes, wickets

## Architecture Decisions

**Why embedded player snapshots in Match documents?**
Avoids `populate()` on the hot scoring path. Every delivery handler reads and writes a single document — no joins, no risk of stale references mid-over.

**Why `GroupPlayerStats` separate from `Player`?**
The same player can have entirely different histories in different groups. A single global stats document would be meaningless — career stats are only useful within the context of a consistent group of players.

**Why atomic bench+replace in one socket event?**
Splitting bench and replace into two events creates a window where a delivery could be recorded between them, placing a ball with a vacant crease position. A single `benchAndReplace` event eliminates this race condition entirely.

**Why the Joker is tracked as two `playerStats` entries?**
One entry per team. Bowling stats route to the bowling-team entry, batting stats route to the batting-team entry. No special-casing needed downstream — all existing stat aggregation logic works without modification.

**Why VersionError retry with exponential backoff on Socket.IO handlers?**
Concurrent delivery events from multiple clients (umpire + scorer) can hit the same Mongoose document version. Three retries at 20ms, 50ms, 80ms intervals resolve conflicts without a distributed lock, keeping the handler stateless.

**Why deterministic stat recalculation at match end?**
Stats computed from the match record at completion, not accumulated live. Undos, corrections, and mid-match changes never produce drift — the final number is always exactly derivable from the timeline.

**Why WebSocket-only transport?**
Long-polling disabled to eliminate the HTTP upgrade round-trip on mobile networks. Players score from their phones on the field — every millisecond of latency is felt.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Scorecard sharing as image export
- [ ] Push notifications for live match updates
- [ ] Tournament bracket and points table
- [ ] Match highlights reel — auto-generated from wickets and big hits
- [ ] DLS method for rain-affected matches

## Known Limitations

- Password reset is name + email match only — no OTP email flow yet
- No offline delivery queue — balls recorded during disconnect are lost on that session
- Scoreboard viewer requires login — public shareable link planned
